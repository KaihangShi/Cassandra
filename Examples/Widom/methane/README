This directory contains all the files needed to run a Gibbs Ensemble
simulation of methane at temperature T=175K with the
chemical potential of the two boxes calculated with Widom insertions.
This example is nearly identical to the Methane example in the GEMC
directory, but it was lengthened and a production run with
Widom insertions was added.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

methane.pdb
    created in Gaussview. Alternatively, this file can be created by hand, Avogadro
    or obtained online.

methane.ff  -- Note that  this file is not included as it is not necessary now
               that methane.mcf has already been generated and included.
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py methane.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters from the TRAPPE forcefield were manually typed into the blank 
    template. TRAPPE parameters for methane are available in the following 
    publication:

      M.G. Martin, and J.I. Siepmann,
      Transferable potentials for phase equilibria. 1. United-atom description 
      of n-alkanes
      J. Phys. Chem. B, 102, 2569-2577 (1998).

methane.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py methane.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file methane.ff in the same directory.

gemc_methane_equil.inp
    The initial density for the liquid and vapor phases were chosen to be close
    to the final density reported by Martin et al.

gemc_methane_widom.inp
    This is the input file for the production run, which features Widom insertions
    and starts from the checkpoint file of the equilibration run.

species1/
    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe gemc_methane_equil.inp methane.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulations can be run with the following commands:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe gemc_methane_equil.inp

then

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe gemc_methane_widom.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named gemc_methane_equil.* or gemc_methane_widom.*, as defined in the input files. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
